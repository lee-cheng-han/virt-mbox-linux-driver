# Bring-Up Guide

This guide tracks the expected path from project source files to a running
QEMU-backed Linux driver stack.

## Current State

The repository contains project-owned QEMU source files, docs, QEMU integration
fragments, and QTest skeletons. It is not a complete QEMU or Linux checkout.

Completed repository milestones:

- Step 0: project contract and planning
- Step 1: minimal QEMU MMIO device source alignment
- Step 2: QEMU integration package
- Step 3: QTest skeleton

Before implementing Step 4 FIFO code, the roadmap and design docs now include
review-readiness requirements for concurrency, lifetime safety, UAPI
correctness, devicetree rigor, observability, testing, and CI.

## Step 1: Validate The Repository

From the repository root:

```sh
make check
```

This runs local hygiene checks that mirror the first CI workflow.

## Step 2: Integrate The QEMU Device

Planned external QEMU work:

- copy `qemu/hw/misc/qemu_mbox.c` into a QEMU source tree
- copy `qemu/include/hw/misc/qemu_mbox.h` into the matching include path
- add the Meson entry from `qemu/patches/meson.build.fragment`
- add the Kconfig entry from `qemu/patches/Kconfig.fragment`
- optionally enable local aarch64 builds with
  `qemu/patches/aarch64-softmmu.default.mak.fragment`
- instantiate the device from a machine, command-line helper, or test harness

The integration notes live in `qemu/patches/README.md`.

Expected early smoke checks:

- ID reads as `0x514d424f`
- VERSION reads as `0x00010000`
- FIFO_DEPTH reads as `16`
- RESET clears CONTROL, STATUS, IRQ_STATUS, and IRQ_ENABLE

## Step 3: Add QTest

QTest coverage starts under:

```text
qemu/tests/qtest/qemu_mbox-test.c
```

The skeleton validates:

- ID
- VERSION
- FIFO_DEPTH
- RESET
- FIFO-backed TX/RX behavior
- byte `0x00` TX count handling

The skeleton becomes runnable after a QEMU machine or QTest harness maps
`virt-mbox` at the test base address.

## Step 4: Real FIFO In QEMU

Goal: replace temporary one-byte behavior with real TX/RX FIFO state.

Build:

- 16-byte TX FIFO
- 16-byte RX FIFO
- FIFO head, tail, and count fields
- FIFO push/pop helpers
- `TX_COUNT`
- `RX_COUNT`
- `TX_FULL`
- `RX_READY`
- `RX_FULL`
- reset clears both FIFOs

## Step 4.5: FIFO Helper Convention And Concurrency Design

Goal: lock down the QEMU FIFO helper convention and Linux driver locking model
before adding real driver I/O.

The design notes live in:

```text
docs/concurrency.md
```

Build:

- QEMU FIFO helper caller assumptions
- QEMU execution-context documentation
- explicit rationale for no QEMU pthread lock in the current model
- Linux driver spinlock plan
- IRQ handler design
- wait queue condition rules
- race-avoidance rules

## Step 5: Processing Timer

Goal: make device behavior asynchronous and realistic.

Build:

- QEMU timer
- `BUSY` status bit
- delayed processing path
- one TX byte processed per timer tick
- result moved into RX FIFO
- timer continues until TX FIFO is empty

Status: implemented in the project-owned QEMU source. External QEMU compile
and runnable QTest verification still require applying the integration package
to a real QEMU checkout.

## Step 6: IRQ Support In QEMU

Goal: raise interrupts when device state changes.

Build:

- QEMU IRQ line
- `sysbus_init_irq`
- IRQ update helper
- `IRQ_STATUS`
- `IRQ_ENABLE`
- write-one-to-clear behavior
- raise IRQ on RX ready
- raise IRQ on TX space
- raise IRQ on done/error

Also update QEMU migration/snapshot support:

- keep `VMStateDescription`
- migrate FIFO contents
- migrate FIFO head/tail/count fields
- migrate BUSY/processing state
- migrate IRQ status and enable state
- document any intentionally non-migrated debug-only fields

Status: implemented in the project-owned QEMU source. External QEMU compile
and runnable QTest verification still require applying the integration package
to a real QEMU checkout.

## Step 7: QTest Expansion

Goal: test the real QEMU hardware model.

Add tests for:

- TX FIFO count
- RX FIFO count
- FIFO full
- FIFO empty
- reset clears FIFOs
- RX read pops data
- status bits
- IRQ status bits
- IRQ enable and masking behavior
- savevm/loadvm or migration-state smoke coverage if practical

Status: expanded in the project-owned QTest skeleton. Runnable QTest execution
still requires applying the integration package to a real QEMU checkout.

## Step 8: Linux Driver Skeleton

Goal: Linux can probe the device.

Files:

- `kernel/drivers/misc/vmbox.c`
- `kernel/include/uapi/linux/vmbox.h`
- `kernel/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/misc/virt,mbox.yaml`

Probe should:

- match `virt,mbox`
- map MMIO
- validate ID and VERSION
- validate FIFO depth
- reset hardware
- request IRQ
- allocate driver state
- add `CONFIG_VMBOX` Kconfig integration
- add Makefile integration
- add SPDX identifiers to new source, header, and binding files

Validate the binding schema through the kernel devicetree binding and
dt-schema flow.

Status: skeleton driver source, UAPI header path, Kconfig fragment, Makefile
fragment, and devicetree binding draft exist in this repository. External
kernel build and dt-schema validation still require applying the fragments to a
real Linux kernel checkout.

## Step 8.5: Device Lifetime And Remove Safety

Goal: make the driver safe if the device is removed while userspace still has
`/dev/vmbox0` open.

Build:

- reference model
- `device_gone` flag
- open/release lifetime handling
- safe remove path
- wake blocked readers and writers during remove
- `-ENODEV` behavior after removal
- single-open policy with `-EBUSY` for a second opener

Status: initial lifetime scaffolding exists in the driver skeleton: explicit
state allocation, `kref`, `device_gone`, single-open state storage, wait queues,
and common teardown that disables IRQ generation, synchronizes/frees the IRQ,
and wakes waiters. Character-device open/release enforcement is now wired into
the Step 9 skeleton.

## Step 9: Character Device Registration

Goal: create `/dev/vmbox0`.

Build:

- `alloc_chrdev_region`
- `cdev_init`
- `cdev_add`
- `class_create`
- `device_create`
- cleanup paths
- `.owner = THIS_MODULE`
- single-open enforcement

Status: implemented in the driver skeleton. The module allocates one device
number, creates a class, registers `/dev/vmbox0`, wires `cdev` open/release
callbacks, enforces single-open with `-EBUSY`, and uses `no_llseek`. Real data
movement is still Step 10.

## Step 9.5: Module Unload Safety

Goal: ensure the module can be inserted, removed, and reinserted cleanly.

Build:

- module metadata
- `.owner = THIS_MODULE`
- correct init/exit cleanup ordering
- common teardown helper shared by platform `.remove()` and module exit paths
- repeated insmod/rmmod test plan

Status: module init/exit paths exist. Module exit unregisters the platform
driver first so per-device `.remove()` runs before class and device-number
teardown. The per-device cleanup path is shared through `vmbox_teardown()`;
external insmod/rmmod testing still requires a real kernel build.

## Step 10: read() And write()

Goal: userspace can send and receive bytes.

Build:

- `.read`
- `.write`
- `copy_to_user()`
- `copy_from_user()`
- MMIO data movement through `readl()` and `writel()`
- short read/write behavior
- error paths

Status: implemented as immediate short I/O. `read()` drains available RX FIFO
bytes into userspace, `write()` pushes bytes while TX FIFO has space, both
return `-ENODEV` after removal and `-EFAULT` on bad userspace pointers. Short
I/O is supported when the FIFO cannot satisfy the full request immediately.

## Step 11: Blocking And Non-Blocking I/O

Goal: real Linux blocking behavior.

Build:

- wait queue for RX data
- wait queue for TX space
- `O_NONBLOCK` handling
- `-EAGAIN`
- `-ERESTARTSYS`
- IRQ-driven wakeups
- `device_gone` handling in wait conditions

Status: implemented. Blocking read/write sleep on wait queues, non-blocking
files return `-EAGAIN`, interrupted waits return `-ERESTARTSYS`, and removal
wakes waiters so they return `-ENODEV`.

## Step 12: poll() Support

Goal: event-driven userspace support.

Return:

- `POLLIN | POLLRDNORM` when RX data exists
- `POLLOUT | POLLWRNORM` when TX space exists
- `POLLERR` when device error is set

Status: implemented. `poll()` registers both wait queues, reports RX/TX
readiness from MMIO FIFO counters, and reports device removal or hardware error
with `POLLERR`.

## Step 13: ioctl() UAPI

Goal: controlled driver commands.

Build:

- `VMBOX_IOC_RESET`
- `VMBOX_IOC_GET_STATUS`
- `VMBOX_IOC_GET_STATS`
- `VMBOX_IOC_SET_MODE`
- `.compat_ioctl` under `CONFIG_COMPAT`
- compile-time UAPI struct size guards
- validation for bad magic, unknown command, bad pointer, invalid mode, and
  nonzero reserved fields

Status: implemented. The UAPI header defines fixed-size status, stats, and mode
structs plus reset/status/stats/mode ioctls. The driver includes ABI size
guards for those exact layouts and implements `.compat_ioctl` by reusing the
native handler because the UAPI contains only fixed-width integers.

## Step 14: sysfs, debugfs, And Observability

Goal: observability.

Expose stable sysfs attributes:

- platform-device `status`
- platform-device `fifo_depth`

Expose:

- `/sys/kernel/debug/vmbox0/stats`
- `/sys/kernel/debug/vmbox0/regs`
- `/sys/kernel/debug/vmbox0/fifo`

Logging requirements:

- use `dev_err()`, `dev_warn()`, `dev_info()`, and `dev_dbg()`
- avoid raw `printk()`
- log probe/remove errors clearly
- keep normal read/write paths quiet

Status: implemented in the driver skeleton. Sysfs exposes `status` and
`fifo_depth`; debugfs exposes `stats`, `regs`, and `fifo`; logging uses
`dev_err()` and `dev_info()` and normal read/write paths remain quiet.

## Step 15: Userspace Test Suite

Goal: test `/dev/vmbox0`.

Add tests for:

- open/close
- basic read/write
- non-blocking read
- non-blocking write
- blocking read wakeup
- blocking write wakeup
- poll wakeup
- ioctl reset
- ioctl status
- ioctl stats
- invalid ioctl
- FIFO full
- FIFO empty
- stress 1000 messages
- udev or device-class permission setup for non-root test users

Status: implemented as `tests/selftests/vmbox_test.c`, with udev permissions
provided by `scripts/udev/99-vmbox.rules`. The test builds in local CI and runs
inside a booted guest with `/dev/vmbox0`.

## Step 15.5: Robustness And Negative Testing

Goal: test teardown paths, compat ioctl, ioctl fuzzing, and blocked I/O failure
cases.

Build:

- remove while open test
- blocked read during remove test
- blocked write during remove test
- repeated module reload test
- 32-bit compat ioctl test if supported
- ioctl fuzz test
- dmesg scan for kernel warnings and errors

Status: implemented as robustness scaffolding in
`tests/scripts/vmbox_robustness.sh` plus the bounded ioctl fuzz plan in
`tests/fuzz/README.md`. Full remove/unbind execution requires a booted kernel
with the driver loaded.

## Step 16: CI Expansion

Goal: automate confidence.

Stages:

- CI v1: repo hygiene
- CI v2: userspace build
- CI v2.5: static analysis and style checks
- CI v3: kernel module build
- CI v4: QEMU device compile
- CI v5: QTest execution
- CI v6: boot QEMU and run userspace tests
- CI v6.5: sanitizer QEMU boot test
- CI v7: end-to-end demo validation

Style and static analysis should include `.clang-format`,
`checkpatch.pl --strict`, `sparse`, and optional `smatch`.

Status: CI now includes repository hygiene, userspace test build, and
static-style scaffolding. Kernel/QEMU compile, QTest, boot, and full runtime CI
remain external integration jobs once real source checkouts are available.

## Step 16.5: Runtime Sanitizer CI

Goal: catch memory safety issues during real driver execution.

Build:

- KASAN-enabled QEMU kernel boot if practical
- kmemleak-enabled boot if practical
- userspace regression tests
- ioctl fuzz tests
- remove/unbind tests
- dmesg and debugfs report scanning

Status: documented in `docs/e2e.md`; the robustness script scans dmesg for
kernel warnings and sanitizer findings. Actual KASAN/kmemleak execution needs a
sanitizer-enabled guest kernel.

## Step 17: End-To-End Bring-Up

Goal: run the whole stack.

Final flow:

```text
QEMU boots Linux
QEMU exposes virt-mbox MMIO device
Linux probes vmbox driver
/dev/vmbox0 appears
userspace test suite runs
all tests pass
```

Status: documented in `docs/e2e.md`, including command shape and guest
validation commands.

## Step 18: Final Demo And Polish

Goal: make it portfolio-ready.

Add:

- final README demo section
- architecture diagram
- QEMU command line
- kernel build notes
- test output
- debugfs sample output
- known limitations
- future work
- MAINTAINERS entry

Status: final documentation, demo notes, known limitations, and MAINTAINERS
coverage are present in this repository.
